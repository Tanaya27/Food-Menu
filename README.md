This C code is a simple program that displays a food menu, prompts the user to pick a food item, and then displays the chosen item along with its price.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
1. It displays a menu of food items along with their corresponding prices.
2. It reads the user's choice of food item.
3. It uses a `switch` statement to determine the selected food item based on the user's choice.
4. It prints the selected food item along with its price.
5. If the user enters an invalid choice, it prints "Invalid choice".

This code can be used as a basic example of using `switch` statements in C and can be helpful for educational purposes or as part of a larger application for managing food orders or menus.

The description highlights the code's functionality and purpose, making it easier for readers to understand its usage and implementation when browsing the GitHub repository's README section.
